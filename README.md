So here we go. What does this do?
# Headers and hyphens ... like football? Okay so a # and a space creates headers
>
## Okay the hashes interact! Up to 6... Line 4 has one # but line 6 has 2 and they look different. Line 2 is smaller!
>
What does a hypen do?
-
>
Okay a hyphen underneath the text on the next line of code also creates a header
>
Equals sign underneath the line does the same thing!
=
>Let's try a quote:
>
>Brilliant, funny...the best math teacher you never had. - *San Francisco Chronicle*.
>
>*I added some emphasis by using the * symbol again enclosing 'San Francisco Chronicle'* 
>
_Now I'll try the other emphasis which is eclosing text in two underscores_
>
**Or even the really strong _emphasis_ using two ** symbols**
>
List time. So I'll make a list of the three best countries in the world using + symbols and a space.
>
+ Ireland.
+ Peru.
+ Spain.
>
Wait I changed my mind. I want to use a - symbol. Okay it does exactly the same thing. As does a * and a space.
>
- Peru 
- Spain 
- Ireland
>
Don't forget the spaces between the * / + / - and the data point(s)!
>
Okay so now I'm going to make a decision about the 3 best countries in the world, using simple numbers followed by a full stop:
>
1. Ireland
2. Spain
3. Peru
>
Now let's add some detail... 
>
1. Ireland
+ Has beautiful landscapes, incredible culture, unbeatable people, a progressive Republican system of governance with a written constitution, and a rich, mystical history. To say nothing of the sublime musicality of Irish Gaelic. 
2. Spain
+ Incredible climate, amazing cuisine, adorable architecture, and coastlines to die for. 
3. Peru
+ Amazing culture, extraordinarily diverse wildlife and topography, best cuisine in the world, astonishing coffee, and an Andean grittiness matched only by its close neighbours (e.g. Colombia).
